<h1> Deirdre Reilly EE417: WebApplication Project Report </h1>
	<h2>Deirdre Reilly - 11304481</h2>
	<h2> Recipe Storage System </h2>
	<br>
	I was randomly assigned the Recipe Storage System. My application can register new users, login users, create recipes, and browse exisiting recipes.
	<br>
	<p>The SQL used to create the tables </p>
	<h3>For the user database:</h3>   
	<p>CREATE TABLE DRusers (accountId INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, name varchar(30), email varchar(30), password varchar(30)PRIMARY KEY (accountId))</p>
					         
	<h3>For the recipes:</h3>   
	<p>CREATE TABLE DRrecipes (name varchar(100),
category varchar(50),
preparation_time number(5),
instructions varchar(1000),
ingredient1 varchar(100),
ingredient2 varchar(100),
ingredient3 varchar(100),
ingredient4 varchar(100),
ingredient5 varchar(100),
quantity1 number(5),
quantity2 number(5),
quantity3 number(5),
quantity4 number(5),
quantity5 number(5),
recipe_id number(5)
)
	</p>   						        
   
	<h3>The Web Application Design</h3> 
	The home page of my application is a navigation page that is used to navigate to the other functions of the website.
	The first step is to login to the system if you are an existing user.
	<br>A servlet checks if the entered user details match any records in the SQL database.If there is a match then the user gets a message to say the login details are correct. They can click to go back to the home page of the website.
	A HTTP session is created and assigned to the logged in user.
	<br> If the incorrect login details are entered the user is prompted with a message to check details and can click to try again.
	Or they can click to register as new user.
	

	<br>The User can register as a new user and enter there name, email and password. The servlet then takes this information and inserts the data into the users table.
	A unique key is generate to and inserted into the accountID field in the table.
	
	<br>A user can create their own 5 ingredient recipe. They have mandatory fields to fill in such as name, category, preparation time, and instructions.
	The user then fills in up to 5 ingredients, quantity, and units. The text fields are inputed with a blank value so they can be sent to the database as null values. 
	The Servlet then Inserts the values into table. Once the recipe is saved the user is prompted the a message that the recipe is saved and can return to the homepage. 
	
	<br> The user can browse existing recipes in the system. There are 3 different ways to browse recipes. 
	The first option is to search the name of the recipe or search the ingredient in the recipe. The Servlet uses a LIKE condition to search the name and ingredient fields in the table. 
	It then presents the results in a table with all the information from the table.
	The second option is to search by category. The user can search for breakfast/snacks/main course etc.. It will pull up recipes stored under that category.
	The third option is to search all exisiting recipes. The servlet Selects all recipes in the Table.
	
	<br> There are several validation checks used throughout the application.
	When registering a new users there is a check to ensure there are no blank fields. As well as to ensure there is a valid email address entered.
	When creating a recipe there is another validation check to ensure the 4 mandatory fields are not blank.
	
	
	<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
	<p>The project can be expanded in the future. The recipe table could contain a field that lists the user that created the recipe.
	The user could then filter to only recipes they have created. This would create a link between the two tables and could be used for a join in the future.
	The user could also tick a box when creating a recipe if they wish their recipe to be public or private. This would create a privacy option for the user. </p>
	
	
	<br/><h3>Servlets/HTML files and their associated servlets:</h3>
	index.html -> Recipe_homepage.html
	<br>Recipe_homepage -> Directs to Login/Register/CreateRecipe/BrowseRecipe.html files
	<br>Login.html -> LoginServlet.java
	<br>Register.html -> RegisterServlet.java
	<br>BrowseRecipe.html -> BrowseRecipe.java
